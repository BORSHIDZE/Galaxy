            Hi, I am Sakshi, a barista, chef, a salesgirl, an IT support Specialist and now, finally turning to my dream
            role UX
            designer. My motto is IDEAS, illustrate designs to empower aspiring solutions. I want to use my skills,
            designs and
            creativity to shape and enhance the ideas or solutions that aspire to change the society and benefit
            every person irrespective of their background. Graduated from Douglas College in March 2022, I have studied
            various
            course works and successfully completed variety of projects and worked diverse set of jobs, all of this
            polishing me
            towards the bigger goal. Since, my childhood I have this fascination towards machines, computers, and
            programming. The
            very first language
            introduced to me in grade 3, was PC Logo where on my commands computer used to draw shapes. That was the
            moment, the
            idea of putting my art ideas in the computer hit me. Currently, I work part-time as Tech Support (Sales) at
            The Source
            and also pursuing Google UX design certification Level 4. Know about me more below...
